# App Overview
Dear Nobody is a VR app that immerses users in an emotional exploration of self-limiting beliefs, inspired by my personal journey to confront feelings of suffocation. This app encourages users to face their own thoughts and emotions through a virtual companion, “Nobody,” guiding them to reflect on memories and gain insights into themselves. Currently in its third iteration, I am preparing Dear Nobody for submission to the Oculus Store and am actively seeking feedback to refine the experience further.

[Here is the app I created so far.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ESUmEQ4jitStQNuzJMfH8MYRdu0sL93K/view?usp=sharing) 

If you want to download it, try to [follow this link](https://oneirosvr.com/how-to-sideload-apps-on-oculus-quest-oculus-go/) to download the Sideload so you can allow Unknown sources on your Quest/Quest2 to play the experience. Please share with me some of your feedback at [my email](mailto:yl3466@nyu.edu) or [DM me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yliu.designs/). Thank you so much. ❤ 

# Background
This project stems from my close-to-death experience, which led me to explore feelings of emotional suffocation through self-reflection. My goal is to help users connect with their own inner experiences and emotions, mirroring my journey of understanding and acceptance. The experience is designed to resonate on a deeply personal level, prompting users to explore their vulnerabilities.

# Development Process
## Research
![assets/dear-nobody/research.jpg](assets/dear-nobody/research.jpg)
- Philosophical Foundations: I delved into stoic and Buddhist philosophies to shape the character “Nobody” and the app’s narrative. This research guided me toward designing a contemplative experience, fostering empathy and emotional awareness.
- Personal Journaling: Throughout the project, I kept a journal of my thoughts, using these reflections to develop character elements that feel authentic and relatable.

## Prototyping
### Iteration 1 
Developed five scenes representing different emotions, allowing users to interact with floating thoughts, animating texts, and switching scenes.

### Iteration 2 
Based on user feedback, I reduced scene clutter, transformed white texts into animated 3D texts, fixed the skybox, and enhanced the poetic quality of the UI for a more immersive experience.

<!-- ### Iteration 3

Currently integrating feedback from a second round of user testing to improve interaction flow and emotional depth. -->
<!-- # Technical Research

## Elements

1. Adobe Audition for Voice Over
2. Ableton for background music tracks 
3. Cinema4d: 3d model, skybox creation
4. Unity: Shader, VR, Interactions, Scripting, & OculusIntegration -->

# User Testing and Feedback
<!-- **User Testing Compilation Video coming soon** -->

During testing with 11 participants (9 with VR headsets), users expressed a sense of connection, with many sharing how they no longer felt alone. Some users even mentioned wanting to continue conversations with “Nobody” and felt a strong emotional urge to embrace her. This feedback validated the app’s ability to evoke a personal and universal emotional response.

# Key Lessons
## Design for the hearts  
This project taught me to prioritize emotional impact, translating complex feelings into VR interactions that resonate universally.

## Consistency in Practice
I spend at least three hours daily on Unity, maintaining momentum and refining the app. I share my progress on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yliu.art/) or [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AeQdyQDNhE&list=PLuoLv7K_RYIEsUSnXdzKRyqfEaX8xnmpk) to document this journey.

## Tech as a Tool, Not a Barrier
Early feedback revealed technical issues that disrupted immersion. By addressing these issues—such as interaction glitches and audio tuning—I was able to create a smoother, more cohesive experience.

# Next Steps

- User-Generated Reflections: I plan to record user responses and save them in a database, allowing new users to hear reflections from previous participants, creating a shared community experience.
- Broader Playtesting: I aim to test with users of varying VR experience levels to optimize accessibility and interaction intuitiveness.
- Festival and Exhibition Submissions: To expand the impact of Dear Nobody, I will submit the app to festivals and exhibitions, encouraging more people to confront and embrace their emotions.
