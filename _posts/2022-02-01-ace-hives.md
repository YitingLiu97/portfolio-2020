# Role 
As a Creative Technologist at Future Colossal, I worked on two of Accenture's eight Innovation Hives at their New York headquarters. Each Hive showcases Accenture’s thought leadership and consulting expertise across different industries, including Smart Living, Finance, Cloud, 5G, Human Potential, New Consumer, Digital Health, and Life Sciences. These immersive installations, developed during the COVID-19 quarantine, use advanced technology and storytelling to bring Accenture’s research and commitment to digital transformation to life.

# Project Highlights
## Smart Living

### Objective
Showcase Accenture's sustainability efforts through an interactive, multimedia display.

### Solution
Created a spherical touchscreen display (Pufferfish Globe), custom NYC steel map with LED backlighting, and two 65” TV screens. The globe interaction triggers dynamic LED animations and data visualizations on the steel map.

### Technical Implementation:
- Designed a communication protocol to send UDP messages from the Pufferfish Globe to Unity and the Artnet Lighting system.
- Implemented real-time heatmap shaders and light mapping with MadMapper for spatial data visualization.
- Overcame challenges with transparent video animations using ffmpeg and HAP codec for display compatibility.

## Finance Forward
![assets/ace-hives/me-in-front-of-ff.jpg](assets/ace-hives/me-in-front-of-ff.jpg)

### Objective

Illustrate the digital transformation in finance using real-time data, AI-driven voice interaction, and historical financial information.
### Solution
Developed an interactive experience with stock tickers, AI-controlled voice interactions, and a rotating dial. Visitors navigate finance trends by voice commands or physical interactions with a dial, with color-coded themes creating an immersive environment.

### Technical Implementation:
- Integrated TD Ameritrade API for live stock data visualization.
- Created a category manager to handle content display for different themes and trigger methods (dial or voice).
- Employed Arduino for dial control and Microsoft Speech Recognition for voice commands, with content dynamically managed through MadMapper for 10 screens.

## Cloud 
###Objective
Demonstrate the advantages of cloud technology in business.
###Solution
Developed free-standing screens with motion sensors that animate and visualize data upon user presence, introducing visitors to Accenture’s cloud services in an interactive, story-driven format.

## Human Potential 
### Objective
Highlight the shift to digital work environments and the importance of global, diverse workforce engagement.
###Solution
Designed an experience utilizing position tracking and a voronoi algorithm to create a honeycomb-like structure symbolizing workforce connectivity. Users’ movements generate ripples, illustrating their impact on the broader network.

## Digital Health 
### Objective
Clear up healthcare misinformation with an interactive experience.
### Solution
Created a digital fog that responds to user movements, revealing health industry innovations. Pausing in front of the display unveils brand messages, offering a reflective, informative experience.

## Life Science 
### Objective
Showcase Accenture’s biopharma and health tech innovations.
### Solution
Set in a lab-themed environment with dynamic DNA animations on LED “test tubes” and interactive screens, guests explore Accenture’s New Science initiatives through docent-triggered content.

## New Consumer 
### Objective
Demonstrate future retail trends.
### Solution
RFID sensors allow interaction with custom 3D-printed “Smart Objects” and “Virtual Objects,” triggering synchronized on-screen replicas, showcasing retail’s digital transformation.

## 5G 
### Objective
Illustrate 5G’s impact on daily life through an AR “window” over Manhattan.
### Solution
An augmented reality display that overlays real-time data on NYC’s skyline, allowing users to interact with 5G-enhanced locations, including live transit data.![assets/ace-hives/5g-2.jpg](assets/ace-hives/5g-2.jpg)
