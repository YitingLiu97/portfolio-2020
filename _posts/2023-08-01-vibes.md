Vibes is a desktop application that transforms music input and AI prompts into dynamic, audio-reactive music videos. This tool allows users to drag and drop audio files, set their creative vision through an AI prompt, and watch as a unique, immersive environment unfolds in sync with the music. I have also used Vibes for live VJ performances, demonstrating its versatility and real-time responsiveness in creating captivating visual experiences.

# My Role & Contributions

- **Creative Development:** Designed the core functionality of Vibes to integrate AI prompt-driven visuals, making it a powerful tool for both music video creation and live VJing.
- **Technical Execution:** Developed the app to be audio-reactive, where visual effects directly respond to the beats and tones of the audio file. This includes synchronizing effects such as color shifts, particle movements, and transitions that enhance the user’s connection with the music.
- **Live Performance Adaptability:** Extended the application’s use for VJ performances, ensuring it could be used in real-time to elevate live music experiences.

# Key Features
- **Audio-Driven Visuals:** Effects and visuals are dynamically generated and respond to the music, offering a unique and personalized music video experience.
- **Customizable AI Prompts:** Users can craft specific visual themes and environments with - AI prompts, adding an element of artistic direction to each video.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** With a drag-and-drop feature for audio files and an intuitive prompt-based input for visuals, Vibes makes music video creation accessible to users of all skill levels.

# Use Cases & Impact

- **VJ Performances:** The app has been successfully used for live performances, bringing audiences a visually immersive experience that adapts to the music in real-time.
- **Creative Tool for Artists:** Vibes empowers artists and musicians to explore AI-driven visuals without needing extensive technical knowledge, bridging the gap between music production and visual storytelling.

# Challenges & Learnings
- **Real-Time Responsiveness:** Ensuring that the application maintains high visual fidelity and responsive frame rates during live performances was essential. I optimized the application’s processing to balance aesthetic quality with performance.
- **AI and Audio Integration:** Integrating AI-generated visuals that remain in sync with audio presented a unique challenge, particularly with balancing the unpredictability of AI-generated visuals and the consistency required for live shows.

# Tools & Technologies
- **Languages and Frameworks:** Unity, custom shaders, and audio-reactive libraries.
- **Design Tools:** Blender for 3D models, Photoshop for UI and asset creation, and various AI tools for generating unique visual styles based on prompts.
