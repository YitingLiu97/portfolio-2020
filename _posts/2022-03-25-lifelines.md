# Info 
Lifelines utilizes augmented reality (AR) to revolutionize therapy during the challenging times prompted by COVID-19, addressing the soaring demand for mental health care. This innovative application empowers therapists and patients to collaboratively build, visualize, and analyze life stories on a 3D timeline, highlighting significant moments for deeper understanding and healing. By merging virtual and physical worlds, Lifelines offers an immersive, interactive experience that enhances patient engagement and makes complex therapy tools more accessible, marking a significant step forward in the integration of technology and mental health care.

# **How we built it**
<!-- can have more process graph -->
We utilized the Hololens 2 to deploy the LifelinesAR app with the help of MRTK and MRDL as our basis for the project. We worked with Unity to create the immmersive AR experience while using Photoshop and Blender for all 2D and 3D design assets. 

Tools:  Hololens 2, MRTK, MRDL, Unity, Blender, Photoshop, etc.

<!-- # **Challenges we ran into** -->

<!-- ## **Interaction design**

We are an ambitious team that wants to move forward beyond this hackathon to continue working on our project to help people to collaborate with their therapists to build, visualize & analyze the story of their life on a 3d timeline with impact moments to bring better understanding and healing. In order to make an easily accessible common therapy tool, we wanted to have the smoothest interaction design. However, it conflicts with the project's scope, so it has been a challenge to keep everyone on the same page while working towards our goal step by step. -->

## Interaction Design

## Working with Hololens

In just one day, I led our team's quick adaptation to Hololens technology, despite all of us being new to it and having varied experience levels in Unity. We focused on learning how to deploy builds to Hololens and started experimenting right away. Using the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) and a shader library, we created engaging effects that activate during user interactions with a 3D timeline of their journey. This was a big step for our team, which includes a product manager, a designer, and three developers, as we had to quickly get up to speed with Hololens. The MRTK workshop was helpful, but it still took us almost a day to get a basic demo running on the Hololens. We also spent considerable time refining our idea to ensure it was achievable within a tight 2.5-day deadline.


<!-- Our team is made up of a product manager, a designer, and three developers. Yet, all of us have no experience working with the Hololens and our three developers have intermediate to advanced levels in Unity. So it is super new for us to work with Hololens. The workshop on MRTK did help but it still took us almost a day to see a simple MRTK demo scene in the Hololens. We also spend hours trying to narrow down our idea to make sure the scope is doable within 2.5 days. -->

<!-- Here is a fun video of me exploring Hololens.

<!-- ## **World Building** -->
<!-- CAN INCLUDE SCREENSHOTS and visual directions? -->

<!-- Originally we wanted to create a whole world that is dreamy, peaceful, and abstract. We implemented particle systems on the floor with flowers and grass assets. Later we scratched that cuz it became distracting. We originally had the mentality of building in VR when approaching the building with Hololens-2. However, we adjusted that soon enough to iterate multiple times to make our app more accustomed to the AR environment. Refining our idea to be something useful as a therapeutic tool for both the therapist and the client.

We did our research and called professionals to refine our UX design, prompt for therapists, user journey, user interaction. It has been a short crunch to make the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) work but we are super proud of where we are at the end of the hackathon. -->

# **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We're so excited we have made an AR therapy product to bring a good social impact. One of our missions is to take care of the mind, emotion, and well-being as a whole. Super proud that Lifelines could help people access therapists easily, get better healing; and also helps therapists to communicate with patients better. We also won MIT Reality Hackathon in 2022 under Wellness category. It feels good to be recognized. 

<!-- # **What's next for Lifelines**

We will add more features in AR for users to have a better interactive process and a better human-technology interface for users to see in a simple way.
