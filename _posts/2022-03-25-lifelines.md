# Overview 
LifelinesAR leverages augmented reality (AR) to transform therapy by meeting the heightened mental health needs brought on by COVID-19. Designed as a collaborative tool for therapists and patients, this app enables users to build, visualize, and analyze life stories on an interactive 3D timeline. By merging the virtual and physical worlds, LifelinesAR creates an engaging, immersive therapy experience that fosters patient engagement and makes therapeutic tools more accessible.

# My Role & Contributions
- **Project Leadership:** I led a cross-functional team through a rapid adaptation to Hololens technology, managing developers, designers, and a product manager within a challenging 2.5-day timeline.
- **Interaction & UX Design:** I developed user interaction flows and implemented engaging effects that respond dynamically on the 3D timeline, enhancing users’ ability to navigate and connect with significant life moments visually.
- **Technical Execution:** Using Unity, MRTK, and MRDL, I ensured our app was built efficiently and deployed on the Hololens 2, integrating 2D and 3D assets from Photoshop and Blender.

**Tools Used:** Hololens 2, Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK), Mixed Reality Design Labs (MRDL), Unity, Blender, Photoshop.


# Project Highlights

- **Hololens Mastery in 1 Day:** I facilitated our team’s swift learning curve with the Hololens, guiding us from setup to creating a functional AR demo within 24 hours.
- **Innovative Interaction Design:** We created a unique, interactive 3D timeline that allows patients and therapists to engage in a visually impactful journey through significant life events.
- **Award-Winning Impact:** LifelinesAR won the MIT Reality Hackathon 2022 Wellness Category, recognizing our achievement in creating an AR solution that bridges technology and mental health for real-world impact.
