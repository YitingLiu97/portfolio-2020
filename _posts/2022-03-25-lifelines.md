**Lifelines is a collaborative therapy tool to build, visualize, and analyze the story of your life on a 3d timeline with impact moments to bring better understanding and healing. With a literal turn of the wrist, easily access common therapy tools such as an Emotions Wheel, Empty Chair, and EMDR exercises will be available for healing.** 

We are the [winner for MIT Reality Hackathon 2022](https://devpost.com/software/lifelines). It feels so rewarding to have created a meaningful tool for good for the mass.

# **Inspiration**

The pandemic has demonstrated how important overall health and well-being are. Therapy is in high demand. With recent government approvals, we use augmented reality (AR) to bring therapies to life by combining virtual and physical worlds. AR helps create rich, interactive experiences with users and helps mental healthcare providers explain treatments to patients more illustratively. AR can significantly enhance patients' engagement and improve education on complex topics.

We built Lifelines to help users collaborate with their therapists to build, visualize & analyze the story of their life on a 3d timeline with Impact Moments to bring better understanding and healing; it can significantly improve access to common therapy tools.

# **Why Augmented Reality(AR)?**

COVID 19 has a huge impact on almost everyone physically and emotionally. A lot of people also have depression during isolation. Therapy is in high demand. AR is a wonderful tool to collaborate with healthcare providers to build, visualize & analyze. therapist. We use AR to bring therapies to life by combining virtual and physical worlds. The experience with your therapist in AR is active and immersive. It assists the user to visualize the moments of their life that were most impactful, allowing them to better process the moment.

# **How we built it**

Hololens 2, MRTK, MRDL, Unity, Blender, Photoshop, etc.

# **Challenges we ran into**

## **Interaction design**

We are an ambitious team that wants to move forward beyond this hackathon to continue working on our project to help people to collaborate with their therapists to build, visualize & analyze the story of their life on a 3d timeline with impact moments to bring better understanding and healing. In order to make an easily accessible common therapy tool, we wanted to have the smoothest interaction design. However, it conflicts with the project's scope, so it has been a challenge to keep everyone on the same page while working towards our goal step by step.

## **Working with Hololens**

Our team is made up of a product manager, a designer, and three developers. Yet, all of us have no experience working with the Hololens and our three developers have intermediate to advanced levels in Unity. So it is super new for us to work with Hololens. The workshop on MRTK did help but it still took us almost a day to see a simple MRTK demo scene in the Hololens. We also spend hours trying to narrow down our idea to make sure the scope is doable within 2.5 days.

Here is a fun video of me exploring Hololens.

## **World Building**

Originally we wanted to create a whole world that is dreamy, peaceful, and abstract. We implemented particle systems on the floor with flowers and grass assets. Later we scratched that cuz it became distracting. We originally had the mentality of building in VR when approaching the building with Hololens-2. However, we adjusted that soon enough to iterate multiple times to make our app more accustomed to the AR environment. Refining our idea to be something useful as a therapeutic tool for both the therapist and the client.

We did our research and called professionals to refine our UX design, prompt for therapists, user journey, user interaction. It has been a short crunch to make the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) work but we are super proud of where we are at the end of the hackathon.

# **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We're so excited we have made an AR therapy product to bring a good social impact. One of our missions is to take care of the mind, emotion, and well-being as a whole. Super proud that Lifelines could help people access therapists easily, get better healing; and also helps therapists to communicate with patients better. We also won MIT Reality Hackathon in 2022 under Wellness category. It feels good to be recognized. 

# **What's next for Lifelines**

We will add more features in AR for users to have a better interactive process and a better human-technology interface for users to see in a simple way.
