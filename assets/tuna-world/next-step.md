Here is the detailed story for further development to include the assets below. 

## Details for the Developed Story

Since I have enriched the story a little bit. There are several things I need to reconsider:

1. Depressing color-scheme:
    1. Hot-> orangish-brown for the plateau
    2. light yellow atmospheric fog as always
    3. Light grayish-blue as the master color scheme
2. Features
    1. Occasional **seagulls** flying - indicating that ocean is not too far away
    2. Few **bushes** to show existence of life between the cracks of the stones
    3. Dry texture of the **rocks and road** - make sure it is hot to touch with your bare feet
    4. **coffin-shaped cave** made up with stones - Tuna's so-called home
    5. **Wild fire** everywhere
    6. **Steaming** hot surroundings
3. Places & actions that can take place - Mixamo and RADiCAL
    1. Within the Coffin
        1. Tuna sleeps and turns back and forth - insomnia
        2. Laying shrugging
        3. laying sleeping
        4. waking
        5. walking out of the coffin - female start walking, walking, female stop walking, walking in circle, female stop and start
        6. Goes out and does her daily routine - shows the player the surrounding
    2. On the Plateau - The rainy day
        1. crying
        2. dancing
    3. The Escape
        1. running, running tired, turn to running, injured run
        2. climbing down the side of the plateau
            1. climbing down wall
            2. climbing
    4. Animations to recapture
        1. Sense of salvation
            1. Joyful jump and dance for a while, cry on the floor while kneeling down
        2. Over-joyously swimming in the ocean
        3. Look up to the sky while taking in all the water she can in the ocean
